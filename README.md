# BandGap_ML
### Introduction
The band gap is a fundamental property in materials science which determines the possible use cases of a material in applications such as optoelectronics, quantum computing, etc. The process of determining the band gap of a material through direct means (opticalabsorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and photoconductivity measurements) or indirect means involving theoretical calculations (Density Functional Theory) requires significant time and capital investment.
